# Implementation Plan Template

This document provides a sprint-based roadmap for [Project Name], breaking development into actionable steps using Agile/Scrum.

## Guidelines for Filling Out This Template
- Replace [Project Name] with your project's name.
- Customize sprints to your timeline (e.g., 2 weeks each, 12 total).
- Use TCREI for tasks (Task, Context, Rules, Examples, Iteration).
- Add dependencies/testing per sprint.
- For agile: Include goals, duration, human/AI roles; adapt for your team size.
- Reference repo structure: Store this in /docs/agents/implementation_plan.md; link to /file_structure.md for sprint-related files in /source/.

## Sprint [Number]: [Name]
**Goals**: [High-level objectives].  
**Duration**: [e.g., 2 weeks].  
**Tasks**:  
1. [Task description (human/AI). TCREI breakdown if complex. Assumptions: [e.g., "Stable deps"]; Known Issues: [e.g., "Mobile lag"].]  
**Dependencies**: [Previous sprint].  
**Testing**: [Criteria, e.g., "[Element] renders on mobile"; run /scripts/test-suite.sh. Assumptions: [e.g., "Test env matches prod"]; Known Issues: [e.g., "Flaky integration"].]
