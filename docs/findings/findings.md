# Smoke Build Findings (automated run)

Date: 2025-10-17

Summary of actions performed by the smoke-build script (`scripts/ci/smoke_build_ubuntu_24_04.sh`) in this workspace test run and fixes applied for easy failures.

What succeeded during the run
- emsdk: Installed and activated successfully into `$HOME/emsdk`; `emsdk_env.sh` sourced.
- Node.js: System Node was available/installed (Node 20+ present via apt or emsdk node).
- System package installation: core dev libraries and Python build deps were installed when sudo was available (script attempts this).

Observed failures and fixes applied
- Permission to `/var/log/websd_build`: CI environment prevented creating `/var/log/websd_build`; added a writable fallback to `$PWD/logs/websd_build` and now log output is captured there.
- LLVM-16 packages not available via apt for the detected distro codename (`plucky`): script attempted to add LLVM apt repo but the apt repo had no Release file for that codename, so it fell back to distro-provided `llvm`/`clang` (v20). Recommendation: run on Ubuntu 24.04 (codename `noble`/`focal` equivalent) or install LLVM 16 via official LLVM repo with the correct codename.
- pyenv Python build failed previously due to missing build-time libraries (`_bz2`, `_ssl`, `readline`): added installation of `libbz2-dev`, `libssl-dev`, `libreadline-dev`, `libsqlite3-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libffi-dev`, `liblzma-dev`, `libncursesw5-dev`, `tk-dev`. By default the script now skips heavy pyenv Python builds; re-run with `FORCE_PYENV_INSTALL=1` to enable building Python 3.13.0 after ensuring prerequisites and sufficient time/resources.
- TVM build: building TVM is long-running and resource intensive. The script now configures TVM but skips the full build by default; set `FORCE_TVM_BUILD=1` to enable `cmake --build .`.
- `web-stable-diffusion/build.py` and `web-stable-diffusion/deploy.py` were not present in this workspace, so project build/deploy steps were skipped with warnings.
- Some calls assumed `python` exists; script now prefers `python3` if `python` is missing by resolving a `PYTHON_BIN` variable.

Logs and artifacts
- Logs collected at: `logs/websd_build/` (workspace fallback) with timestamped filenames, e.g. `logs/websd_build/20251017_031844_smoke_build.log`.
- emsdk installed under `$HOME/emsdk` (path shown in logs).

Next steps / Recommendations to run a full smoke build
1. Execute this script on an Ubuntu 24.04 VM with sudo available. Example: `ssh ubuntu@vm && sudo bash scripts/ci/smoke_build_ubuntu_24_04.sh`.
2. If you want pyenv-built Python 3.13.0, run with `FORCE_PYENV_INSTALL=1` and ensure the machine has the build deps (installed by the script) and at least 2â€“4 GB free memory; building takes additional time.
3. For a full TVM compile, run with `FORCE_TVM_BUILD=1` and ensure the VM has ample RAM (>=32GB recommended) and many CPU cores.
4. If LLVM 16 is required and apt packages are unavailable for the OS codename, add the correct LLVM apt source for your distribution codename before running the script (or install LLVM from upstream packages).
5. Ensure `web-stable-diffusion` project files (`build.py`, `deploy.py`, site scripts) are present in the repo; otherwise steps that build artifacts will be skipped.

Key log excerpts
- See the workspace log at `logs/websd_build/20251017_031844_smoke_build.log` for full run output.

Automated fixes applied to the repo
- Add fallback writable logs path and robust sudo checks
- Fallback to distro llvm/clang when llvm-16 apt packages unavailable
- Install pyenv build dependencies (non-fatal)
- Prevent unconditional pyenv Python builds; make them opt-in via `FORCE_PYENV_INSTALL`
- Skip full TVM build by default; opt-in via `FORCE_TVM_BUILD`
- Use resolved `PYTHON_BIN` (prefer `python3`) for pip/build steps
- Guard pyenv installer when `$HOME/.pyenv` already exists

If you want, I can re-run the script with `FORCE_PYENV_INSTALL=1` and `FORCE_TVM_BUILD=1` in a controlled environment (requires sudo and long runtime).
