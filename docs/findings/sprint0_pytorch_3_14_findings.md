# Sprint 0 â€” PyTorch vs Python 3.14 Findings

**Summary**
- PyTorch wheel support for CPython 3.14 is present for recent releases (e.g., `torch-2.9.0` includes `cp314` wheels for Linux/x86_64, manylinux aarch64, macOS arm64, and Windows).
- Project current environment in this workspace is Python 3.13.3; pip index lists torch up to 2.9.0.

**Details**
- I inspected PyPI metadata for the `torch` package and enumerated release filenames. `torch==2.9.0` includes `cp314` wheel filenames indicating official binary distribution for Python 3.14 across major platforms.
- Older releases (2.7.x) include `cp312`, `cp311`, `cp310` wheels but not `cp314`.

**Implication for project**
- Targeting Python 3.14 is feasible because PyTorch publishes `cp314` wheels for recent releases (2.9.0 at least). The project can proceed to target Python 3.14, but should pin the `torch` minor version (e.g., `torch>=2.9.0`) and test CI runners.
- If project depends on PyTorch 2.7 specifically (per `technology_stack.md`), we must verify whether PyTorch 2.7.x publishes `cp314` wheels; in PyPI data, 2.7.x releases show up to `cp312` only. If 2.7 is a hard requirement, fallback to Python 3.13 or build PyTorch from source.

**Recommended next steps**
- Confirm project's required PyTorch minor version (2.7 vs 2.9) in code and CI; update `docs/agents/technology_stack.md` if changing the target.
- Run CI job or ephemeral container with Python 3.14 and `pip install torch==2.9.0` to validate binary wheel compatibility across the build pipeline.
- If sticking to PyTorch 2.7, test building from source on Python 3.14 or pin to Python 3.13 in `pyproject`/CI.
