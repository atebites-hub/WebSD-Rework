## Task (TCREI)
- **Task**: Confirm TVM v0.21 can be built from source and that a tvmjs runtime bundle (tvmjs_runtime.wasi.js / tvmjs.bundle.js) can be produced and used by the web runtime.
- **Context**: See `docs/agents/implementation_plan.md` (Sprint 0 Task 2). Relevant code paths: `web-stable-diffusion/web/`, `web_stable_diffusion/`, build scripts such as `build.py` and any `tvm*`/`tvmjs` scripts or folders.
- **Rules**: Follow project rules in `docs/agents/` and Memory System workflow. Do not change main branch; record findings and create artifacts under `docs/findings/`.
- **Examples**: Look for existing tvm build commands, `export_library` usage, any mentions of `tvmjs`, `wasm`, or `webgpu` target.
- **Iteration**: Steps: 1) locate build scripts and tvmjs code, 2) attempt to document required commands and dependencies, 3) run a local smoke build (if asked), 4) record issues and next actions.

## Lessons
### Background & Motivation
Confirm a reproducible process to build tvm v0.21 artifacts and produce a tvmjs runtime so the web demo can load compiled models using WebGPU.

### Key Challenges & Analysis
- Assumptions: The repository may already include helper scripts to export TVM libraries; tvmjs bundle steps may be partially documented.
- Counterpoints: If tvmjs artifacts are not present, building TVM v0.21 from source may be required, which is time/resource intensive.
- Alternatives: Use prebuilt tvmjs runtime from a known source or containerize the build.
- Risks: Long build times, environment mismatch (WASI/WebGPU), missing dependencies.

### Feedback & Assistance
- Request: If building from source is needed, confirm whether I should attempt a local build in this environment or only document the steps.

### Learnings
- Findings saved to `docs/findings/sprint0-task2.md`. Key repository references and recommended next steps are recorded there (build vs. prebuilt decision, containerized build suggestion).
