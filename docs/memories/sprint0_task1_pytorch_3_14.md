## Task (TCREI)
- **Task**: Verify PyTorch compatibility with Python 3.13 for the build pipeline
- **Context**: Repository targets Python 3.13; build pipeline uses PyTorch 2.7 for model tracing (TorchDynamo/FX) and TVM Relax frontend. Relevant docs: `docs/agents/implementation_plan.md`, `docs/agents/technology_stack.md`, `docs/memory_template.md`.
- **Rules**: Follow project scope and documentation rules in `/docs/agents`; record findings in `docs/findings`.
- **Iteration**: Run compatibility checks, check for published PyTorch wheels for CPython 3.13, attempt to install in a disposable environment, and record outcome.

## Lessons
### Background & Motivation
PyTorch availability on CPython 3.13 determines whether the project's compile pipeline can target 3.13 and remain compatible with PyTorch 2.7.

### Key Challenges & Analysis
- Assumptions: PyTorch 2.7 is required by the project; targeting Python 3.13 avoids the need to build PyTorch from source.
- Counterpoints: Upgrading PyTorch in the future may enable newer Python versions; this should be managed as a separate change.
- Alternatives: Build PyTorch from source on 3.14 (costly) or pin to 3.13 (chosen).
- Risks: If a critical dependency later requires Python >3.13, the project will need a planned migration.

### Feedback & Assistance
Decision recorded: Project will target Python 3.13 with PyTorch 2.7. To change this decision requires a documented upgrade plan and CI validation.

### Learnings
- Prefer binary wheel compatibility to reduce CI time and complexity.
- Keep an automation checklist for upgrading Python major/minor versions.
