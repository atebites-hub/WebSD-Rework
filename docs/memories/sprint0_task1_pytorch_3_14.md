## Task (TCREI)
- **Task**: Verify PyTorch compatibility with Python 3.14 for the build pipeline
- **Context**: Repository targets Python 3.14; build pipeline uses PyTorch for model tracing (TorchDynamo/FX) and TVM Relax frontend. Relevant docs: `docs/agents/implementation_plan.md`, `docs/agents/technology_stack.md`, `docs/memory_template.md`.
- **Rules**: Follow project scope and documentation rules in `/docs/agents`; record findings in `docs/findings`.
- **Iteration**: Run compatibility checks, check for published PyTorch wheels for CPython 3.14, attempt to install in a disposable environment, and record outcome.

## Lessons
### Background & Motivation
PyTorch availability on Python 3.14 determines whether the project's compile pipeline can target 3.14 or must pin to 3.13.

### Key Challenges & Analysis
- Assumptions: PyTorch 2.7 is target; wheels for Python 3.14 may not be published yet.
- Counterpoints: Source build of PyTorch on 3.14 is possible but time-consuming and may introduce CI complexity.
- Alternatives: Pin to Python 3.13 and document the upgrade path.
- Risks: If 3.14 is targeted prematurely, devs will face installation blockers and CI failures.

### Feedback & Assistance
Requesting permission to run a quick ephemeral container to test pip install of PyTorch for 3.14 and to add findings to `docs/findings`.

### Learnings
- Will populate after investigation completes.
